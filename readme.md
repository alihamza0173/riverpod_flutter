Examples of Flutter State Managment package **Riverpos** from simple to advance.


## what are riverpods

**Riverpod** is a state management library for Flutter applications that makes it easier to manage the state of your application with less boilerplate code. It's built on top of Provider, another popular state management library in Flutter. Riverpod provides more control and scalability in managing state, as well as better performance over time.

With Riverpod, you can define providers, which are objects that contain state or logic that can be accessed by other widgets in your application. Providers can be easily updated and consumed throughout your app using the `Consumer` widget or the `ProviderListener` widget. This allows you to manage state in a more organized way, making it easier to test and debug your app.

Unlike Provider, which relies on dependency injection using an `InheritedWidget`, Riverpod uses Dart’s built-in global key-value store, which is simpler to use and has better performance. Additionally, Riverpod offers a feature called "auto-dispose", which will automatically clean up unused providers after they have been inactive for some time, freeing up memory and improving performance.

Overall, Riverpod is a powerful and flexible state management solution that can help you build complex applications with ease.
